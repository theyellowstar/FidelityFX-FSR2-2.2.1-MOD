2023-05-12 | FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.2.1
-------
- Fixed comments in API header for incorrect cameraFar use.
- Fixed DRS issue where resource was not correctly cleared on first use.

- Fixed incorrect luma resource size.

2023-02-23 | FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.2.0a
-------
- Minor updates to the documentation
- Removal of a handful of files from the prior release that are no longer part of FSR 2.2.

2023-02-16 | FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.2.0
-------
- Introduction of API debug checker.
- Changes to improve "High Velocity Ghosting" situations.
- Changes to Luminance computation with pre-exposure application.
- Small motion vectors ignored in previous depth estimation.
- Changes to depth logic to improve disocclusion detection and avoid self-disocclusions.
- Dilated reactive mask logic updated to use temporal motion vector divergence to kill locks.
- New lock luminance resource.
- Accumulation overhauled to use temporal reactivity.
- Changed how intermediate signals are stored and tonemapped.
- Luminance instability logic improved.
- Tonemapping no longer applied during RCAS to retain more dynamic range.
- Fixes for multiple user reported issues on GitHub and elsewhere. Thank you for your feedback!

2022-10-10 | FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.1.2
-------
- Fix resource precision issue.
- Clamp coordinates in software sampling logic.

2022-09-13 | FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.1.1
-------
- Fix issue with reprojection data on a reset.

2022-09-06 | FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.1
-------
- Reactivity mask now uses full range of value in the mask (0.0 - 1.0).
- Reactivity and Composition and Transparency mask dialation is now based on input colors to avoid expanding reactiveness into non-relevant upscaled areas.
- Disocclusion logic improved in order to detect disocclusions in areas with very small depth separation.
- RCAS Pass forced to fp32 mode to reduce chance of issues seen with HDR input values.
- Fix for display-resolution motion vectors interpretation.
- FP16/FP32 computation review, readjusting balance of fp16/fp32 for maximum quality.
- Amended motion vector description within the documentation.
- Various documentation edits for spelling.
- Clarified the frame delta time input value within the readme documentation.
- Fixed issue with bad memset within the shader blob selection logic.


2022-06-22 | FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.0.1
-------
- First release.
